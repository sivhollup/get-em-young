## Context

@quote[the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and in terms of which it can be fully understood.]

Note: 
- What is context?
- circumstances (omstendigheter, sammenheng)
- environment (milj√∏)
- the stuff that gives meaning to the situation/word/sentence
- to stuff that weaves together meaning
- computer is stupid
- same behaviour in different contexts gives different results

### Assumptions
@quote[A thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof.]
@snapend

Note: 
- Everything we take for granted
- closely connected to context, because in a given context we have a lot of
  assumptions
- examples: we read from left to right (but not in japan)
- natural reading order: high to low
- right and left (facing each other)
- recipies: take two eggs
- look into eyes: trust or challenge?
- body language?

## Sequences and ordering

@quote[A particular order in which related things follow each other.]

Note: 
- putting events after one another
- ordering: something comes before something else
- order matters: if you change the order, the sequence becomes different


---

## Determinism

@quote[In computer science, a deterministic algorithm is an algorithm which, given a particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying machine always passing through the same sequence of states]


Note: 
- related to sequences and ordering, and also context
- when you perform the same sequence with the same input, you get the same
  result
- even simpler: doing the same routine gives the same result

## @color[black](Execution and behaviour)
@snapend

Note:
- executing a program
- behaviour?
- to execute a sequence is to perform exactly what is given in the sequence,
  nothing more, nothing less
- No room for changes
- Or can we change execution "runtime": how? 


---

## Abstraction

@quote[The quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.]

Note: 
- Something which exists only as an idea.
- how do we use abstraction?
- We abstract away details
- Different levels of abstraction (different things are important in different
  contexts)
- can we make ideas out of real things? Events? How do we perform abstraction?


---

## Equality

@quote[Equal: Being the same in quantity, size, degree, or value.]

Note: 
- separating ideas, objects, movements, what is really the same and what is different
- when are two things the same? 
- Equality: The state of being equal, especially in status, rights, or opportunities


---

## Comparison

@quote[Estimate, measure, or note the similarity or dissimilarity between.]

Note:
- how do we compare different events, objects? 
- closely related to equality
