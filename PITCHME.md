## @color[#394A53](Get'em while they're young)

Note:
- we learn about programming too late
- many of the thought processes we use are universal
- problem solving is useful in other arenas as well
- basic programming concepts are alreadyy all around us
- who is siv: developer at kantega and associate professor at uib. Made a game
  for preschoolers last year and feels strongly that we should start teaching
  concepts necessary for learning how computing works as early as possible. 
- who is kjersti: pre school teacher

## @color[#160A07](Goal)
@snapend

Note:
- today: make games for non-programmers
- explore existing games
- small or large game
- can involve a computer, but not a requirement
- thought processes and concepts that are important
- what is the goal of the games we make?
- show computational thinking (beregningsbasert tankegang)
- show discrete (as in mathematics) realm (diskret matte)
- show problem solving the "computational way"
- start with some basic concepts that could be a basis for a game 
- not exhaustive list, we'll probably come up with more

## @color[#394A53](Context)
@snapend

Note: 
- the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and
  in terms of which it can be fully understood.
- circumstances (omstendigheter, sammenheng)
- environment (miljø)
- the stuff that gives meaning to the situation/word/sentence
- the stuff that weaves together meaning
- same behaviour in different contexts gives different results
- computer is stupid (does not have context other than what you give)
- going straight forwards is ok in context where there are no obstacles
- going straight where you have obstacles in the way gives different result

### Assumptions
@snapend

Note: 
- antagelser
- A thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof
- Everything we take for granted
- closely connected to context, because in a given context we have a lot of
  assumptions
- examples: we read from left to right (but not in japan)
- right and left (facing each other)
- recipies: take two eggs
- look into eyes: trust or challenge?

## Sequence and order
@snapend

Note: 
- rekkefølge
- A particular order in which related things follow each other.
- putting events after one another
- ordering: something comes before something else
- order matters: if you change the order, the sequence becomes different

@snap[south]
## Comparison

a < b
@snapend

Note:
- Estimate, measure, or note the similarity or dissimilarity between.
- how do we compare different events, objects? 
- closely related to equality
- other related concepts: greater than, lesser than

## @color[#394A53](Equality)
@snapend


Note: 
- Equal: Being the same in quantity, size, degree, or value.
- Equality: The state of being equal, especially in status, rights, or opportunities
- also related to: 
- separating ideas, objects, movements, what is really the same and what is different
- when are two things the same?

## Determinism
@snapend

Note: 
- In computer science, a deterministic algorithm is an algorithm which, given a
  particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying
  machine always passing through the same sequence of states
- related to sequences and ordering, and also context
- when you perform the same sequence with the same input, you get the same
  result
- even simpler: doing the same routine gives the same result

@snap[north-east]
## @color[#394A53](Execution and behaviour)
@snapend

Note:
- executing a program
- behaviour?
- to execute a sequence is to perform exactly what is given in the sequence,
  nothing more, nothing less
- No room for changes
- Or can we change execution "runtime": how?

@snap[north-east]
## @color[#394A53](Abstraction)
@snapend


Note: 
- The quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.
- Something which exists only as an idea.
- how do we use abstraction?
- We abstract away details
- Different levels of abstraction (different things are important in different
  contexts)
- can we make ideas out of real things? Events? How do we perform abstraction?

@snap[north-east]
## Repetition<br/> patterns
@snapend

Note:
- how can we use small blocks and repeat them?
- generalisation: what is common in a problem
- closely related to functions (or separating different parts)
- figuring out the pattern (i.e.: the function game (black-box-testing))

## Conditionals
@snapend

Note: 
- specific choices
- choosing between two (or more)
- yes or no, not maybe
- everything is definite
- defining clear "tests"

@snap[south-east]
## @color[#394A53](Problem solving)
@snapend

Note:
- broader scope than many of the others
- what are the commonalities in how we solve problems?
- maybe this is aggragating above-mentioned points?
- what IS problem solving? 
- computational thinking

## @color[#332F27](Communication)
@snapend

Note: 
- how to communicate precisely
- different roles in communication

## Planning
@snapend

Note:
- what is the goal of the game?
- who is the target audience?
- how much time do you think one game will last?
- do you need to prepare anything?
- how many can play the game?
- kjersti takes over!

@snap[north-west]
## @color[#394A53](Group size)

Note: 
- Size of the group depends of age and interst (once again). 3-4 is optimal but
  in a preschool we don’t get many of these oportuneties. If the group are
  equally interested and motivated/qurious it’s ok to have a larger group, but I
  would’nt recomend more than 6-8 for best outcome.

@snap[north-east]
## Time frame
@snapend

Note:
- How long can the kids keep consentrated? It depends of interested we manage to
  keep them. Same goes for agegroup, the older they are, the more they can take
  part in the activity by themselves. The oldest kids are better talkers and
  therfor can participate verbally as well.  For all agegroups it’s best with
  short instuctions and simple rules, otherwise they may lose interest before
  even starting..

@snap[span-45 west]
### Participation
@snapend

Note:
- What do we have to think about when we’re making stuff for them??
- Kids love to be challenged, they love to use their brain, they love to move,
  they love to find out things by themselves – they can count several numbers
  (individual differences of course), they can relate to rules – though it’s
  more fun to break them...
- they are thrilled when they can take part in new activities where they can take the lead
- great sense of humor

@snap[south-west]
## @color[#394A53](Derailing)
@snapend

Note: 
- when working with kids it’s important to be aware of their – sometimes weird -
  way of thinking, it’s not always the same as the adults. Often they suggest
  other outcomes of the activity than we have planned and going along with their
  ideas is a good way to keep them motivated. We also have to let them now that
  it’s ok to fail, and that it can be a good thing to do things over again, then
  the solution may even be a better one.

@snap[north]
## @color[#394A53](Expectations)
@snapend

Note:
- Soo…what can we expect from an average 5 or 6- year old?? ….EVERYTHING!!!
- while the 5 year olds can be in great harmony with themselves, the 6 year olds
  can be both amazingly incredible and amazingly irritably at the same time.
- there are some differenses in 5 and 6 years olds; the 5 year olds are much
  more in peace with themselves while the 6 year old is struggling with what we
  call the early puberty; they are growing in fast pace, moodchanges, lacking
  control of their body and so on.. these things can be of value to think about
  while we are planning activities for them
- do not make the mistake of comparing 5- and 6 year olds, or kids in similar
  age, there are huge differenses; maturing, interests, intelligence…
- Logic thinking, great ability to reflection, find soulutions, remodel and do
  over to get it right, they can focus and hold their consentration for a longer
  period as long as they find the activity interesting and challenging (for the
  most. There will always be differences in a similar agegroup, but here we are
  talking about the average kid)
