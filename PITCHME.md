## @color[#394A53](Get'em while they're young)

Note:
- who is siv: developer at kantega and associate professor at uib. Made a game for
  preschoolers last year and feels strongly that we should start teaching
  concepts necessary for learning how computing works as early as possible. 
- who is kjersti: 


---?image=https://images.pexels.com/photos/214573/pexels-photo-214573.jpeg


Note:
- goal for today: make small or larger programming games for non-programmers
- what is the goal of the games we make?
- learn someone about computational thinking, and the discrete (as in
  mathematics) realm, about problem solving the "computational way"
- start with some basic concepts that could be a basis for a game

## @color[#394A53](Context)
@snapend

Note: 
- What is context?
- the circumstances that form the setting for an event, statement, or idea, and
  in terms of which it can be fully understood.
- circumstances (omstendigheter, sammenheng)
- environment (milj√∏)
- the stuff that gives meaning to the situation/word/sentence
- the stuff that weaves together meaning
- same behaviour in different contexts gives different results
- computer is stupid (does not have context other than what you give)

### Assumptions
@snapend

Note: 
- A thing that is accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof
- Everything we take for granted
- closely connected to context, because in a given context we have a lot of
  assumptions
- examples: we read from left to right (but not in japan)
- natural reading order: high to low
- right and left (facing each other)
- recipies: take two eggs
- look into eyes: trust or challenge?
- body language?

## Sequence and order
@snapend

Note: 
- A particular order in which related things follow each other.
- putting events after one another
- ordering: something comes before something else
- order matters: if you change the order, the sequence becomes different

## Determinism
@snapend

Note: 
- In computer science, a deterministic algorithm is an algorithm which, given a
  particular input, will always produce the same output, with the underlying
  machine always passing through the same sequence of states
- related to sequences and ordering, and also context
- when you perform the same sequence with the same input, you get the same
  result
- even simpler: doing the same routine gives the same result

@snap[north-east]
## @color[#394A53](Execution and behaviour)
@snapend

Note:
- executing a program
- behaviour?
- to execute a sequence is to perform exactly what is given in the sequence,
  nothing more, nothing less
- No room for changes
- Or can we change execution "runtime": how?

## @color[#394A53](Abstraction)
@snapend


Note: 
- The quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.
- Something which exists only as an idea.
- how do we use abstraction?
- We abstract away details
- Different levels of abstraction (different things are important in different
  contexts)
- can we make ideas out of real things? Events? How do we perform abstraction?

@snap[north-east]
## @color[#394A53](Equality)
@snapend


Note: 
- Equal: Being the same in quantity, size, degree, or value.
- Equality: The state of being equal, especially in status, rights, or opportunities
- also related to: 
- separating ideas, objects, movements, what is really the same and what is different
- when are two things the same? 


---?color=#394A53

## Comparison

a < b

Note:
- Estimate, measure, or note the similarity or dissimilarity between.
- how do we compare different events, objects? 
- closely related to equality
- other related concepts: greater than, lesser than

## Repetition<br/> patterns
@snapend

Note:
- how can we use small blocks and repeat them?
- generalisation: what is common in a problem
- closely related to functions (or separating different parts)
- figuring out the pattern (i.e.: the function game (black-box-testing))

## Conditionals
@snapend

Note: 
- specific choices
- choosing between two (or more)
- yes or no, not maybe
- everything is definite
- defining clear "tests"

## @color[#394A53](Problem solving)
@snapend

Note:
- broader scope than many of the others
- what are the commonalities in how we solve problems?
- maybe this is aggragating above-mentioned points?
- what IS problem solving? 
- computational thinking

## @color[#332F27](Communication)
@snapend

Note: 
- how to communicate precisely
- different roles in communication

## Things to<br/> think about
@snapend

Note:
- what is the goal of the game?
- who is the target audience?
- what can you expect them to know?
- how much time do you think one game will last?
- how long will the target audience be able to keep their focus?
- do you need to prepare anything?
- how many can play the game?
